# aoc-2022-haskell

[Advent of Code 2022](https://adventofcode.com/2022) in vanilla Haskell
(incomplete).

started with 0 haskell knowledge. earlier solutions were updated as i
accumulated haskell experience

- my favourite: `06`
- my hardest: `07`

to run the solutions, i recommend using `runghc [FILE]` in the `solutions/`
directory. each day has a corresponding file as a solution, which outputs two
lines when run (one for each part of the puzzle)
