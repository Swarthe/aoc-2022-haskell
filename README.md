# aoc-haskell

[Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2022) in vanilla Haskell (partial).

I made this in order to learn haskell. earlier solutions were updated as i
accumulated haskell experience

to run the solutions, i recommend using `runghc [FILE]` in an `src/[YEAR]`
directory. for example, use `runghc 09` in `src/2022` to run the solution to day
9 of AoC 2022. this project doesn't use a build system

each completed day has a corresponding file as a solution, which outputs two
lines when run (one for each part of the puzzle). the solutions are designed to
be as general as possible.
