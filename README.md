# aoc-2022-haskell

[Advent of Code 2022](https://adventofcode.com/2022) in vanilla Haskell
(incomplete).

started with 0 haskell knowledge, and used the puzzles to learn haskell.
earlier solutions were updated as i accumulated haskell experience

- my favourites: `06`, `09`, `11`
- my hardest: `07`, `09`

to run the solutions, i recommend using `runghc -w [FILE]` in the `solutions/`
directory. each day has a corresponding file as a solution, which outputs two
lines when run (one for each part of the puzzle)
